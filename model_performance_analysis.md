# Model Performance Analysis Report

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Training Dynamics Problems
- **Validation Performance Ceiling**
  - mAP50 stalls at ~0.34 (target >0.70)
  - Training loss decreases but doesn't translate to validation improvements
  - Significant overfitting indicated by divergence between training and validation metrics

- **Detection Quality Issues**
  - Extremely low recall (0.04-0.05) - model misses 95% of cattle
  - Unstable precision (0.25-0.58) - inconsistent detection quality
  - mAP50-95 is very low (0.13) indicating poor localization accuracy

### 2. Dataset Issues
```plaintext
Training Set:
- Total Images: 7,993
- Total Labels: 4,562
- Unlabeled Images: 3,431 (43% of training set)
```

- **Data Quality Problems**
  - Large number of augmented images (`.rf.` files) without labels
  - Significant portion of training images (43%) have no labels
  - Potential label quality issues based on precision fluctuations

### 3. Model Architecture Concerns
- Complex fusion architecture might be overkill for single-class detection
- Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) with multiple scales adds complexity
- No evidence that small object detection features are being utilized effectively

### 4. Training Configuration Issues
- Static learning rate (0.0001) despite performance plateau
- Small batch size (4) may cause gradient instability
- No learning rate scheduling or warmup period
- No explicit data augmentation strategy despite having augmented images

## Recommendations

### 1. Immediate Actions
1. **Clean Up Dataset**
   - Remove all unlabeled augmented images (`.rf.` files)
   - Validate remaining label quality
   - Consider using only original images for training

2. **Simplify Model Architecture**
   ```python
   # Recommended architecture changes
   - Remove Feature Pyramid Network
   - Use single-scale detection head
   - Consider simpler backbone (e.g., ResNet50)
   ```

3. **Improve Training Configuration**
   ```python
   # Recommended hyperparameters
   learning_rate = 0.001  # Increase initial LR
   batch_size = 16       # Increase if memory allows
   warmup_epochs = 5     # Add warmup period
   ```

### 2. Long-term Improvements
1. **Data Enhancement**
   - Implement controlled data augmentation during training
   - Add validation set annotations
   - Consider collecting more labeled data

2. **Training Strategy**
   - Implement learning rate scheduling (cosine decay)
   - Add early stopping based on validation metrics
   - Implement gradient clipping

3. **Model Optimization**
   - Experiment with simpler architectures
   - Focus on single-scale detection
   - Add regularization techniques

## Expected Impact
- Cleaning up the dataset should immediately improve training stability
- Simpler architecture could improve convergence speed
- Better training configuration should lead to higher mAP50 scores
- Target: Achieve mAP50 > 0.5 in first phase, then optimize for > 0.7

## Next Steps
1. Clean dataset and remove augmented files without labels
2. Implement simpler model architecture
3. Update training configuration with recommended parameters
4. Add proper learning rate scheduling
5. Retrain model and monitor validation metrics
